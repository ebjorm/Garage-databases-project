# Garage-databases-project

Project for databases course

The project consists of two phases and aims to practice the design and implementation of relational databases. In the first phase, a UML diagram of the planned database and a relational model based on it are submitted. In the second phase, an SQL database is created based on the solution from the first phase. There is no user interface for the database, but the designed database is implemented and SQL queries created for it are tested in a real database environment.

The final report can be found in garage.pdf and the SQL state ments in the .sql files as well as in the final report.
